# Text Summarization Using SBERT and SVD

## Overview
This repository contains a **text summarization system** that utilizes **SBERT embeddings, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Cosine Similarity** to generate extractive and centrality-based summaries. The system is designed to process multiple articles or paragraphs, summarize them efficiently, and rank them based on importance.

## Features
- **Dual Summarization Methods**: 
  - **Extractive Summarization**: Identifies key sentences based on similarity to provided highlights.
  - **Centrality-Based Summarization**: Selects important sentences using sentence centrality and dimensionality reduction (SVD).
- **Batch Processing**: Supports multiple articles or paragraphs via CSV upload.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses **SBERT** embeddings to capture contextual meaning.
- **Ranking Capability**: Implements LexRank to rank articles based on importance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Streamlit** for easy interaction.
- **Multilingual Support** (requires fine-tuning).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries
- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `nltk`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `scikit-learn`

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Uploading Articles
- Users can **upload a CSV file** or manually input articles and highlights.
- The system processes the text and **generates summaries** based on selected methods.
- For large datasets, results are displayed in a DataFrame format for better readability.
